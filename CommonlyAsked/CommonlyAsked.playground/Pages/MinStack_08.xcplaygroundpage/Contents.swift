/*
  
 Challenge:
 
 Design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function
 'min' which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in
 O(1) time.
 
 ======================================================
 
 
 Doing it with a Linked List.

 Stacks can be implemented as either arrays or via a linked list.
 If we do it with a linked list, we can store the current minimum value
 with each new node as we pop it onto the list.
 
 That way we have a running record of what the current min was, and the time
 the node was added.
 
 Genious!

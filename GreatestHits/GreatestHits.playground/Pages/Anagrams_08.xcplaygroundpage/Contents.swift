    Challenge:
        Given two strings, write an algorithm to detect whether one word is an anagram of the other.
        An anagram is a word that can be made by changing the order of the letters in another word.

    For example:
        tar => rat
        state => taste
*/

/*
    We could create a Dictionary of each word, and do a count comparison
    like we did in ransom note. Or, we could note that two sorted String
    equal to each other would also be anagrams.
